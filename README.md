# Stick Tennis

[Live](http://www.wesleyrobinson.me/stick-tennis)

Stick Tennis is a clone of the classic Atari Pong game.  Compete against the computer AI to see if you can outplay him! Use the up and down arrow keys to control your paddle on the right side of the court. Don't get caught sleeping, because game play doesn't stop until one player gets to 11 points!
